Thanks for using the galaxy clustering interface.

The module enables the use of a custom xml file to specify 
grids that are avaliable to galaxy.

A possible usecase for this module is a 
galaxy local server with limited requirements

local job runner.
pbs cluster 
and a drmaa cluster.

The ability for the galaxy user to be able 
to select where the jobs get run.

Also added splitting functionality to enable the user to 
split files by megabase pairs and other such constructs.



TODO------


Get basic split working with vcf merge 
think of an elegant way to do it

Keep UI functions as stubs that is the very last
part of the project


----

---INSTALLATION---

Grid selection is installed by running the script and changing 
the $GALAXY_HOME_DIR variable to reference your galaxy home folder.

two variable are required to be set in the galaxy settings universe file.

self.enable_clustering_interface=True
and self.clustering_config_file=<location of grid_conf.xml>
